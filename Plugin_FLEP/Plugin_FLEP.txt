This document describes the script commands that are standalone.

Original bridges
================

Brings back the bridges used in TR4, as TRNG bridges have incompatible behaviour.

To assign a slot:

AssignSlot=<MyUsedSlot>,<Bridge>

Where <Bridge> is either OBJ_FLEP_BRIDGE_FLAT, OBJ_FLEP_BRIDGE_TILT1 or OBJ_FLEP_BRIDGE_TILT2.

Lift doors
==========

Implements the lift doors from TR5.

To assign a slot:

AssignSlot=<MyUsedSlot>,<LiftDoor>

Where <LiftDoor> is either OBJ_FLEP_LIFT_DOORS1 or OBJ_FLEP_LIFT_DOORS2.

Additional customization can be done by the command Customize=CUST_FLEP_LIFT_DOORS.

Sprite objects
==============

Implements objects that always face the camera, as sprites do.

To assign a slot:

AssignSlot=<MyUsedSlot>,<Sprite>

Where <Sprite> is OBJ_FLEP_SPRITE{1..16}.

If the object has more than one mesh, they will be cycled through, like animated sprites.

Old style rollingballs
======================

Provides the rollingballs from TR1/2/3.

To assign a slot:

AssignSlot=<MyUsedSlot>,<Rollingball>

Where <Rollingball> is OBJ_FLEP_ROLLINGBALL{1..16}.

Use OCB 1 to disable the camera bounce effect. Add 32 to the OCB to produce a splash if the rollingball falls into water.
Note that the rotation of the rollingball determines their rolling direction.

The rollingballs from original levels will not work, use these ones instead: https://www.trsearch.org/item/5823.

Meshswap of Lara meshes
=======================

Allows Lara meshes to be swapped.

To do a meshswap:

#define @Plugin_FLEP 1
TriggerGroup=<TriggerGroupId>,$012000,7,<IdParamList>
#define @plugins CLEAR

Where <IdParamList> is the Id of the command Parameters=PARAM_FLEP_LARA_MESHSWAP.
And to revert a meshswap:

#define @Plugin_FLEP 1
TriggerGroup=<TriggerGroupId>,$012000,8,<LaraMesh>
#define @plugins CLEAR

Where <LaraMesh> is a LARA_MESH_ constant.

Exit game
=========

Exits the game in the same moment it is called.

To exit the game:

#define @Plugin_FLEP 1
TriggerGroup=<TriggerGroupId>,$012000,9,$0
#define @plugins CLEAR

Old style trapdoors
===================

Provides the trapdoors from TR1/2/3.

To assign a slot:

AssignSlot=<MyUsedSlot>,<Trapdoor>

Where <Trapdoor> is OBJ_FLEP_TRAPDOOR{1..16}.
